## What is it? ##
As a student who enjoys studying in cafes and restaurants, and is acquainted with many likeminded individuals, I wanted to create and Yelp-Style app to help people find suitable locations for remote work and study.

## MVP Plan: ##
```
[]  Create the framework
[]  Create Website
[]  Create Database
[]  Create Fillable Forms
[]  Create Sign-in Pages 
        []	User
                        *Name (First and Last....  is that needed?)
                        *User Name
                        *Password
                        *Email address
        []	Restaurant
                        *Restaurant Name
                        *Address
                        *Phone Number
                        *Hours
                        *Capacity
[]  Find and Create APIs
        []	Research Google Maps API
[]  Create Comments Page
[]  Select appropriate colors, pictures, and Icons for page
[]  Create pseudo-locations or select a handful to test
[]  Have Icons change color based on rating
        [] Handicap Accessability
        [] Bathroom Cleanliness
        [] Other Things?
        [] Overall Rank (Should that be case by case or auto-cumulative of other scores?)
[]  User Survey for Restaurant
        *Tables/Seating/Standing
        *Power Outlets
        *Noise
        *Added Perks
[]  Keywords in Search Options and Results
        [] Added Perks
```
## Advanced Plans: ##
```
[]  Create Curation/Favorites option
[]  Create Roulette option (Picks a restaurant within a distance range)
[]  Add API to show how busy a location is
[]  Add Pop-up alerts
[]  Add a Colorblind option
```
## Thoughts and Maybes ##
```
[]  Should I add Terms and Conditions in the future?
[]  TBD
