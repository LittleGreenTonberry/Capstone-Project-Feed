## Why? ##
As a student who enjoys studying in cafes and restaurants, and is acquainted with many likeminded individuals, I wanted to create and Yelp-Style app to help people find suitable locations for remote work and study.

## MVP Plan: ##
```
[]  Create the framework
[]  Create Website
[]  Create Database
[]  Create Fillable Forms
[]  Create Sign-in Pages 
        []	User
        []	Restaurant
[]  Find and Create APIs
        []	Research Google Maps API
[]  Create Comments Page
[]  Select appropriate colors, pictures, and Icons for page
[]  Create pseudo-locations or select a handful to test
```
## Advanced Plans: ##
```
[]  Create Curation/Favorites option
[]  Create Roulette option (Picks a restaurant within a distance range)
[]  Add API to show how busy a location is
[]  Add Pop-up alerts
[]  Have Icons change color based on rating
[]  Add a Colorblind option
```
