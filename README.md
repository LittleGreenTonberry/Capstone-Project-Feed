## ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ##
Class Whatever, am I right?

## Features ##
As a student, I want to be able to find locations that are close to home/dorm, comfortable and not crowded, with access to Wi-Fi, light snacks, and power supplies.

As a remote worker, I have no idea....  >_< 


## Data Models ## ((I wish I knew how to draw))

Users types are split into General User and Restaurant as follows:
```
        []	User
                        *Name (First and Last....  is that needed?)
                        *User Name
                        *Password
                        *Email address
        []	Restaurant
                        *Restaurant Name
                        *Address
                        *Phone Number
                        *Hours
                        *Capacity
```
Survey Models are as follows :
```
        *Tables/Seating/Standing
        *Power Outlets
        *Noise
        *Food
        *Service
        *Handicap Accessability
        *Bathroom Cleanliness
        *TBD
        *Added Perks
```
## MVP Plan: ##
```
[]  Create the framework
[]  Create Website
[]  Create Database
[]  Create Fillable Forms
[]  Create Sign-in Pages 
[]  Find and Create APIs
        []	Research Google Maps API
        []      Research a few other APIs (Forgot their names)
[]  Create Comments Page
[]  Select appropriate colors, pictures, and Icons for page
[]  Create pseudo-locations or select a handful to test
[]  User Survey for Restaurant
[]  Apply Rating System
[]  Apply Keywords in Search Options and Results
```
## Advanced Plans: ##
```
[]  Create Curation/Favorites option
[]  Ensure Mobile-Friendliness
[]  Create Roulette option (Picks a restaurant within a distance range)
[]  Add API to show how busy a location is
[]  Add Pop-up alerts
[]  Add a Colorblind option
[]  Have Icons change color based on rating        
```
## Thoughts and Maybes ##
```
[] Overall Rank (Should that be case by case or auto-cumulative of other scores?)
[]  Should I add Terms and Conditions in the future?
[]  TBD
```
